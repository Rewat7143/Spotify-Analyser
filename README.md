<h1 align="center">Spotify Data Analysis</h1>




Analyzing Spotify data using Python involves leveraging the Spotify Web API and Python programming language to extract, process, and analyze various aspects of music-related data available through Spotify's platform. This data analysis can provide valuable insights into user preferences, trends, and patterns within the music industry.

## About the Project

"Spotify, established in April 2006, is a Swedish provider of audio streaming and media services. It stands as the largest music streaming service globally, boasting a user base of more than 381 million monthly active users, which encompasses 172 million paid subscribers.

The exploration of the Spotify dataset involved comprehensive data cleaning, enabling exploratory data analysis (EDA), and facilitating data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The data analysis phase delved into investigating the correlation between a song's audio features and the sentiment expressed in its lyrics. This included conducting sentiment analysis and exploring various other aspects.

By utilizing secondary data sourced from Spotify, the Spotify Data Analysis project aims to unveil patterns and relationships among different attributes within the dataset. This endeavor aids in honing the skills required to review and interpret complex datasets."
